  abstract     = {The subject of this paper is the design and calibration of an open-ended coaxial probe for the nondestructive measurement of the dielectric properties of concrete. Measurements are made between 100-900 MHz, frequencies which are often used in geophysics and civil engineering for ground penetrating radar inspection. The probe is calibrated using measurements on saline solutions in conjunction with three different mathematical techniques for comparative study. Measurements of mortar and concrete specimens having different water/cement ratios were made in order to observe the standard deviations due to their heterogeneous nature. Similar to the case of relatively homogeneous rock specimens (limestone and granite), the standard deviation for heterogeneous concrete samples do not exceed 5\%. In addition, the effect of the concrete's porosity on its dielectric properties was clearly observed: measured permittivity between 4-4.5 at 900 MHz for porous concrete, and between 6.5-7.5 at 900 MHz for dense concrete.},

The data can be fitted to a Debye relaxation spectrum with a relaxation frequency of about 0.27 GHz, leading to a nearly frequency-independent penetration depth of about 1 m over the range from 1-10 GHz. The spectrum can be explained by Maxwell-Wagner losses of semiconducting spheres embedded in a nonconducting sand medium.},

These two quantities are not yet available globally or with adequate temporal or spatial sampling. It is recognized that a spaceborne L-band radiometer with a suitable antenna is the most promising way of fulfilling this gap. With these scientific objectives and technical solution at the heart of a proposed mission concept the European Space Agency (ESA) selected the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission as its second Earth Explorer Opportunity Mission. The development of the SMOS mission was led by ESA in collaboration with the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES) in France and the Centro para el Desarrollo Tecnologico Industrial (CDTI) in Spain. SMOS carries a single payload, an L-Band 2-D interferometric radiometer operating in the 1400-1427-MHz protected band . The instrument receives the radiation emitted from Earth's surface, which can then be related to the moisture content in the first few centimeters of soil over land, and to salinity in the surface waters of the oceans. SMOS will achieve an unprecedented maximum spatial resolution of 50 km at L-band over land (43 km on average over the field of view), providing multiangular dual polarized (or fully polarized) brightness temperatures over the globe. SMOS has a revisit time of less than 3 days so as to retrieve soil moisture and ocean salinity data, meeting the mission's science objectives. The caveat in relation to its sampling requirements is that SMOS will have a somewhat reduced sensitivity when compared to conventional radiometers. The SMOS satellite was launched successfully on November 2, 2009.},

  abstract     = {The importance of snow cover extent (SCE) has been proven to strongly link with various natural phenomenon and human activities; consequently, monitoring snow cover is one the most critical topics in studying and understanding the cryosphere. As snow cover can vary significantly within short time spans and often extends over vast areas, spaceborne remote sensing constitutes an efficient observation technique to track it continuously. However, as optical imagery is limited by cloud cover and polar darkness, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) attracted more attention for its ability to sense day-and-night under any cloud and weather condition. In addition to widely applied backscattering-based method, thanks to the advancements of spaceborne SAR sensors and image processing techniques, many new approaches based on interferometric SAR (InSAR) and polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) have been developed since the launch of ERS-1 in 1991 to monitor snow cover under both dry and wet snow conditions. Critical auxiliary data including DEM, land cover information, and local meteorological data have also been explored to aid the snow cover analysis. This review presents an overview of existing studies and discusses the advantages, constraints, and trajectories of the current developments.},

The model differs from established models by the high degree of flexibility in switching between different electromagnetic theories, representations of snow microstructure, and other modules involved in various calculation steps. SMRT v1.0 includes the dense media radiative transfer theory (DMRT), the improved Born approximation (IBA), and independent Rayleigh scatterers to compute the intrinsic electromagnetic properties of a snow layer. In the case of IBA, five different formulations of the autocorrelation function to describe the snow microstructure characteristics are available, including the sticky hard sphere model, for which close equivalence between the IBA and DMRT theories has been shown here. Validation is demonstrated against established theories and models. SMRT was used to identify that several former studies conducting simulations with in situ measured snow properties are now comparable and moreover appear to be quantitatively nearly equivalent. This study also proves that a third parameter is needed in addition to density and specific surface area to characterize the microstructure. The paper provides a comprehensive description of the mathematical basis of SMRT and its numerical implementation in Python. Modularity supports model extensions foreseen in future versions comprising other media (e.g., sea ice, frozen lakes), different scattering theories, rough surface models, or new microstructure models.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

It is demonstrated that an accurate modeling of the liquid water distribution inside the snowpack, using a multilayer meteorological snow model, is required to characterize snow with precision. A multilayer-snow electromagnetic (EM) backscattering model is developed based on the vector radiative transfer, the strong fluctuation theory, and physical parameters supplied by the meteorological model. However, the limited resolution of the meteorological snow model is insufficient for predicting a refined EM backscattering at a massif scale. An adequate spatial reorganization of these snow profiles, based on a comparison between simulated and measured dual-polarization SAR data, leads to a better estimation of some snowpack parameters. In particular, the monitoring of snow liquid water content is presented improving the capacity of wet snow mapping as compared to a classical SAR-based method. This methodology shows good capacities both for qualitative and quantitative snow assessments, opening the way for a new operational method.},

Particularly in winter, frozen soil permittivity and roughness are two poorly characterized unknowns that must be considered. Here, we show that after removing snow, the 3D soil roughness can be accurately inferred from in-situ photogrammetry using Structure from Motion (SfM). We focus on using SfM techniques to provide accurate roughness measurements and improve emissivity models parametrization of frozen arctic soil for microwave applications. Validation was performed from ground-based radiometric measurements at 19 and 37 GHz using three different soil emission models: the Wegmüller and Mätzler [1999, TGRS] model (Weg99), the Wang and Choudhury [1981, JGR] model (QNH), and a geometrical optics model (Geo Optics). Measured and simulated brightness temperatures over different tundra and rock sites in the Canadian High Arctic show that Weg99, parametrized with SfM-based roughness and optimized permittivity (ε), yielded an RMSE of 3.1 K ( R2=0.71) for all frequencies and polarizations. Our SfM based approach allowed us to measure roughness with 0.1 mm accuracy at 55 locations of different land cover type using a digital camera and metal plates of know dimensions.},

Part I presents the results of dielectric constant measurements conducted for five different soil types at frequencies between 1.4 and 18 GHz. Soil texture is shown to have an effect on dielectric behavior over the entire frequency range and is most pronounced at frequencies below 5 GHz. In addition, the dielectric properties of frozen soils suggest that a fraction of the soil water component remains liquid even at temperatures of -24° C. The dielectric data as measured at room temperature are summarized at each frequency by polynomial expressions dependent upon both the volumetric moisture content m and the percentage of sand and clay contained in the soil; separate polynomial expressions are given for the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant. In Part II, two dielectric mixing models will be presented to account for the observed behavior: 1) a semiempirical refractive mixing model that accurately describes the data and requires only volumetric moisture and soil texture as inputs, and 2) a theoretical four-component mixing model that explicitly accounts for the presence of bound water.},

  abstract     = {The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission is European Space Agency (ESA's) second Earth Explorer Opportunity mission, launched in November 2009. It is a joint program between ESA Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES) and Centro para el Desarrollo Tecnologico Industrial. SMOS carries a single payload, an L-Band 2-D interferometric radiometer in the 1400-1427 MHz protected band. This wavelength penetrates well through the atmosphere, and hence the instrument probes the earth surface emissivity. Surface emissivity can then be related to the moisture content in the first few centimeters of soil, and, after some surface roughness and temperature corrections, to the sea surface salinity over ocean. The goal of the level 2 algorithm is thus to deliver global soil moisture (SM) maps with a desired accuracy of 0.04 m3/m3. To reach this goal, a retrieval algorithm was developed and implemented in the ground segment which processes level 1 to level 2 data. Level 1 consists mainly of angular brightness temperatures (TB), while level 2 consists of geophysical products in swath mode, i.e., as acquired by the sensor during a half orbit from pole to pole. In this context, a group of institutes prepared the SMOS algorithm theoretical basis documents to be used to produce the operational algorithm. The principle of the SM retrieval algorithm is based on an iterative approach which aims at minimizing a cost function. The main component of the cost function is given by the sum of the squared weighted differences between measured and modeled TB data, for a variety of incidence angles. The algorithm finds the best set of the parameters, e.g., SM and vegetation characteristics, which drive the direct TB model and minimizes the cost function. The end user Level 2 SM product contains SM, vegetation opacity, and estimated dielectric constant of any surface, TB computed at 42.5°, flags and quality indices, and other parameters of interest. This paper gives an overview of the algorithm, discusses the caveats, and provides a glimpse of the Cal Val exercises.},

  abstract     = {The dependence of the dielectric constant, at frequencies between 1 MHz and 1 GHz, on the volumetric water content is determined empirically in the laboratory. The effect of varying the texture, bulk density, temperature, and soluble salt content on this relationship was also determined. Time-domain reflectometry (TDR) was used to measure the dielectric constant of a wide range of granular specimens placed in a coaxial transmission line. The water or salt solution was cycled continuously to or from the specimen, with minimal disturbance, through porous disks placed along the sides of the coaxial tube. Four mineral soils with a range of texture from sandy loam to clay were tested. An empirical relationship between the apparent dielectric constant Ka and the volumetric water content θv, which is independent of soil type, soil density, soil temperature, and soluble salt content, can be used to determine θv, from air dry to water saturated, with an error of estimate of 0.013. Precision of θv to within ±0.01 from Ka can be obtained with a calibration for the particular granular material of interest. An organic soil, vermiculite, and two sizes of glass beads were also tested successfully. The empirical relationship determined here agrees very well with other experimenters' results, which use a wide range of electrical techniques over the frequency range of 20 MHz and 1 GHz and widely varying soil types. The results of applying the TDR technique on parallel transmission lines in the field to measure θv versus depth are encouraging.},

Part II draws upon the data presented in Part 1 [13] to develop appropriate empirical and theoretical dielectric mixing models for the 1.4-to 18-GHz region. A semiempirical mixing model based upon the index of refraction is presented, requiring only easily ascertained soil physical parameters such as volumetric moisture and soil textural composition as inputs. In addition, a theoretical model accounting explicitly for the presence of a hydration layer of bound water adjacent to hydrophilic soil particle surfaces is presented. A four-component dielectric mixing model treats the soil-water system as a host medium of dry soil solids containing randomly distributed and randomly oriented disc-shaped inclusions of bound water, bulk water, and air. The bulk water component is considered to be dependent upon frequency, temperature, and salinity. The soil solution is differentiated by means of a soil physical model into 1) a bound component and 2) a bulk soil solution. The performance of each model is evaluated as a function of soil moisture, soil texture, and frequency, using the dielectric measurements of five soils ranging from sandy loam to silty clay (as presented in Part I [13]) at frequencies between 1.4 and 18 GHz. The semiempirical mixing model yields an excellent fit to the measured data at frequencies above 4 GHz. At 1.},

  abstract     = {Ground surface freeze-thaw cycles caused by changes in solar radiation have a great impact on soil-air water heat exchanges due to the phase transition of pore water. This influence should not be ignored in the land surface process and global environment change studies because of its large extent and the rapid changes in daily and seasonal frozen ground. The key index for evaluating the influence intensity is the content of water-ice phase transition in soil pores at the ground surface. In this paper, a data set was generated by observing field experiments and physical model simulations based on the configuration of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSR-E). The results showed that microwave radiation from freezing/thawing soil has an obvious correlation to the phase transition process of soil water. A large change in soil surface emissivity was shown after the freezing of soil. The magnitude of the difference in emissivity change is strongly related to the amount of water-ice phase transition. It can be shown that the higher the phase transition water content (PTWC), the greater the emissivity difference, and the higher the frequency, the smaller the emissivity difference. Based on an analysis of a large amount of random simulation data, an interesting characteristic was found, in that the emissivity difference in vertical polarization at each frequency is nearly proportional to the phase transition water content. Thus, a ratio index called Quasi-emissivity (Qe) was developed to eliminate temperature effects during retrieval. Using these clear rules, a physical statistical algorithm was put forth to estimate the phase transition water content. Finally, the inferred results by ground-based radiometer observation were compared with the ground truth. A satisfying agreement was achieved with a root mean square error of 0.0265 (v/v). This indicated that the microwave radiometer has a great potential in the measurement of PTWC.},

  abstract     = {Key observational indicators of climate change in the Arctic, most spanning a 47 year period (1971–2017) demonstrate fundamental changes among nine key elements of the Arctic system. We find that, coherent with increasing air temperature, there is an intensification of the hydrological cycle, evident from increases in humidity, precipitation, river discharge, glacier equilibrium line altitude and land ice wastage. Downward trends continue in sea ice thickness (and extent) and spring snow cover extent and duration, while near-surface permafrost continues to warm. Several of the climate indicators exhibit a significant statistical correlation with air temperature or precipitation, reinforcing the notion that increasing air temperatures and precipitation are drivers of major changes in various components of the Arctic system. To progress beyond a presentation of the Arctic physical climate changes, we find a correspondence between air temperature and biophysical indicators such as tundra biomass and identify numerous biophysical disruptions with cascading effects throughout the trophic levels. These include: increased delivery of organic matter and nutrients to Arctic near-coastal zones; condensed flowering and pollination plant species periods; timing mismatch between plant flowering and pollinators; increased plant vulnerability to insect disturbance; increased shrub biomass; increased ignition of wildfires; increased growing season CO2 uptake, with counterbalancing increases in shoulder season and winter CO2 emissions; increased carbon cycling, regulated by local hydrology and permafrost thaw; conversion between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems; and shifting animal distribution and demographics. The Arctic biophysical system is now clearly trending away from its 20th Century state and into an unprecedented state, with implications not only within but beyond the Arctic.

  abstract     = {Cold region hydrology is conditioned by distinct cryospheric and hydrological processes. While snowmelt is the main contributor to both surface and subsurface flows, seasonally frozen soil also influences the partition of meltwater and rain between these flows. Cold regions of the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes have been shown to be sensitive to climate change. Assessing the impacts of climate change on the hydrology of this region is therefore crucial, as it supports a significant amount of population relying on hydrological services and subjected to changing hydrological risks. We present an exhaustive review of the literature on historical and projected future changes on cold region hydrology in response to climate change. Changes in snow, soil, and streamflow key metrics were investigated and summarized at the hemispheric scale, down to the basin scale. We found substantial evidence of both historical and projected changes in the reviewed hydrological metrics. These metrics were shown to display different sensitivities to climate change, depending on the cold season temperature regime of a given region. Given the historical and projected future warming during the 21st century, the most drastic changes were found to be occurring over regions with near-freezing air temperatures. Colder regions, on the other hand, were found to be comparatively less sensitive to climate change. The complex interactions between the snow and soil metrics resulted in either colder or warmer soils, which led to increasing or decreasing frost depths, influencing the partitioning rates between the surface and subsurface flows. The most consistent and salient hydrological responses to both historical and projected climate change were an earlier occurrence of snowmelt floods, an overall increase in water availability and streamflow during winter, and a decrease in water availability and streamflow during the warm season, which calls for renewed assessments of existing water supply and flood risk management strategies.},

  abstract     = {The presence of seasonal snow cover during the cold season of the annual air temperature cycle has significant influence on the ground thermal regime in cold regions. Snow has high albedo and emissivity that cool the snow surface, high absorptivity that tends to warm the snow surface, low thermal conductivity so that a snow layer acts as an insulator, and high latent heat due to snowmelt that is a heat sink. The overall impact of snow cover on the ground thermal regime depends on the timing, duration, accumulation, and melting processes of seasonal snow cover; density, structure, and thickness of seasonal snow cover; and interactions of snow cover with micrometeorological conditions, local microrelief, vegetation, and the geographical locations. Over different timescales either the cooling or warming impact of seasonal snow cover may dominate. In the continuous permafrost regions, impact of seasonal snow cover can result in an increase of the mean annual ground and permafrost surface temperature by several degrees, whereas in discontinuous and sporadic permafrost regions the absence of seasonal snow cover may be a key factor for permafrost development. In seasonally frozen ground regions, snow cover can substantially reduce the seasonal freezing depth. However, the influence of seasonal snow cover on seasonally frozen ground has received relatively little attention, and further study is needed. Ground surface temperatures, reconstructed from deep borehole temperature gradients, have increased by up to 4°C in the past centuries and have been widely used as evidence of paleoclimate change. However, changes in air temperature alone cannot account for the changes in ground temperatures. Changes in seasonal snow conditions might have significantly contributed to the ground surface temperature increase. The influence of seasonal snow cover on soil temperature, soil freezing and thawing processes, and permafrost has considerable impact on carbon exchange between the atmosphere and the ground and on the hydrological cycle in cold regions/cold seasons.},

  abstract     = {General circulation models consistently predict that regional warming will be most rapid in the Arctic, that this warming will be predominantly in the winter season, and that it will often be accompanied by increasing snowfall. Paradoxically, despite the strong cold season emphasis in these predictions, we know relatively little about the plot and landscape-level controls on tundra biogeochemical cycling in wintertime as compared to summertime. We investigated the relative influence of vegetation type and climate on CO2 production rates and total wintertime CO2 release in the Scandinavian subarctic. Ecosystem respiration rates and a wide range of associated environmental and substrate pool size variables were measured in the two most common vegetation types of the region (birch understorey and heath tundra) at four paired sites along a 50 km transect through a strong snow depth gradient in northern Sweden. Both climate and vegetation type were strong interactive controls on ecosystem CO2 production rates during winter. Of all variables tested, soil temperature explained by far the largest amount of variation in respiration rates (41–75\%). Our results indicate that vegetation type only exerted an influence on respiration when snow depth was below a certain threshold (~1 m). Thus, tall vegetation that enhanced snow accumulation within that threshold resulted in more effective thermal insulation from severe air temperatures, thereby significantly increasing respiratory activity. At the end of winter, within several days of snowmelt, gross ecosystem photosynthesis rates were of a similar magnitude to ecosystem respiration, resulting in significant net carbon gain in some instances. Finally, climate and vegetation type were also strong interactive controls on total wintertime respiration, suggesting that spatial variations in maximum snowdepth may be a primary determinant of regional patterns of wintertime CO2 release. Together, our results have important implications for predictions of how the distribution of tundra vegetation types and the carbon balances of arctic ecosystems will respond to climate change during winter because they indicate a threshold (~1 m) above which there would be little effect of increased snow accumulation on wintertime biogeochemical cycling.},

  abstract     = {The intensity brightness temperature (TB) of the microwave emission from the soil is determined primarily by its dielectric properties. The large difference between the dielectric constant of water (≅80) and that of dry soil (3-5) produces a strong dependence of the soil's dielectric constant on its moisture content. This dependence is effected by the texture of the soil because the water molecules close to the particle surface are tightly bound and do not contribute significantly to the dielectric properties. Since this surface area is a function of the particle size distribution (soil texture), being larger for clay soils with small particles, and smaller for sandy soils with larger particles; the dielectric properties will depend on soil texture. This dependence has been demonstrated by laboratory measurements of the dielectric constant for soils which are briefly summarized in this paper. The dependence of the microwave emission on texture is demonstrated by measurements of TB from an aircraft platform for a wide range of soil textures. The main conclusion of the paper is that the effect of soil texture differences on the observed TB values can be normalized by expressing the soil moisture values as a percentage of field capacity (FC) for the soil.},

New measurements of with improved accuracy were made with a specially designed resonator operating near 1 GHz. The coaxial sensor accurately defines the sample volume whose actual mass can be determined to give the density of the snow sample. A special electronic instrument, called a resometer, enabled accurate and rapid measurements under field conditions. Some 90 measurements of different kinds of dry snow (fresh, old, wind-pressed snow, depth hear, and refrozen crusts) were made at test sites in the Swiss and Austrian Alps. The data indicate that /spl epsiv/ is a function of snow density only, given that the standard deviation of 0.006 from the fitted curve is just due to the expected measurement errors. The interpretation of these data in terms of physical mixing theory favors the effective medium formula of Polder and van Santen (1946). The data allow to relate the average axial ratio X as a function of ice volume fraction. Both prolate and oblate spheroids can explain the data. Independent reasoning gives preference to oblate particles. In both cases, the axial ratio increases with increasing fraction up to a critical value of 0.33, followed by a decrease at still higher fractions. The destructive metamorphism of slowly compacting snow explains the increase of X, while the following decrease might be due to sintering. So far, no effect on /spl epsiv/ by a liquid-like surface layer on the ice grains at temperatures between -10/spl deg/C and 0/spl deg/C has been observed.},

In this work the authors report on new measurements made over the frequency range from 2 to 100 GHz by a resonator method (2-10 GHz) and a radiometer method (10-100 GHz). Measurements were made with pure and with slightly saline (10 to 13 p.p.m.) ice. The results agree with the assumption of a single minimum of the dielectric loss at 2 to 4 GHz. For pure ice the data are a natural link between the measurements of Westphal made below 1 GHz and the far-infrared spectrum. The influence of small impurities on the dielectric loss is compared with the behaviour of sea ice, and it is found that the same linear relationship with salinity can be applied to both cases.},

  abstract     = {Basal depth hoar that forms in Arctic snowpacks often has a low thermal conductivity, strongly contributing to the snowpack thermal insulance and impacting the permafrost thermal regime. At Ward Hunt Island (Canadian high Arctic, 83°05′N, 74°07′W) almost no depth hoar was observed in spring 2016 despite favorable thermal conditions. We hypothesize that depth hoar formation was impeded by the combination of two factors (1) strong winds in fall that formed hard dense wind slabs where water vapor transport was slow and (2) low soil moisture that led to rapid ground cooling with no zero-curtain period, which reduced soil temperature and the temperature gradient in the snowpack. Comparisons with detailed data from the subsequent winter at Ward Hunt and from Bylot Island (73°09′N, 80°00′W) and with data from Barrow and Alert indicate that both high wind speeds after snow onset and low soil moisture are necessary to prevent Arctic depth hoar formation. The role of convection to form depth hoar is discussed. A simple preliminary strategy to parameterize depth hoar thermal conductivity in snow schemes is proposed based on wind speed and soil moisture. Finally, warming-induced vegetation growth and soil moisture increase should reduce depth hoar thermal conductivity, potentially affecting permafrost temperature.},

Analysis of thermal data from an arctic site and a mid-latitude location suggests that the phenomenon may be a universal characteristic of wet, medium-textured mineral and organic soils during freezing. Nonconductive processes play an important role in formation and maintenance of the zero-curtain effect. Water advection, condensation, and evaporation events are recognizable in mappings of thermal and ion concentration records on time-depth meshes. The zero curtain appears to be produced and maintained by vapor transport and internal distillation mechanisms, driven by osmotic potential variations induced by freeze-thaw events at the soil surface. The term zero curtain is applicable to locations outside permafrost regions, but units of measurements should not be assigned to it.},

The water content of the soils was varied from 0.0 g H2O/g soil to 0.15 g H2O/g soil, and the temperature from 24°C to 20°C. The dielectric relaxation spectrum of water in soils was found to be displaced to lower frequencies than the dielectric relaxation spectrum of water in bulk. The results showed that the relation between volumetric water content and the complex dielectric constant is relatively independent of soil type. At temperatures above freezing the complex dielectric constant of water in soils, at the water contents investigated, decreases with temperature, a type of behavior normally found only in solids. Below the freezing point the phase composition of water in soils determines the temperature dependence of the complex dielectric constant.},

Moisture content is given special attention because of its practical significance in remote sensing and because it represents the single most influential parameter as far as soil dielectric properties are concerned.

These curves, presented in both tabular and graphical form, were chosen as representative of the reported experimental data.

The frequency range is covered by two instruments: by an LCR meter (frequencies up to 5 MHz) and by a vector network analyzer (VNA) (frequencies from 0.3 MHz to several gigahertz). In the high band (0.1-8.5 GHz), the cell is a coaxial line segment filled with the investigated substance. To determine the CRP, the complex transmission coefficient (scattering matrix parameter S12) of this cell is measured by using a VNA. For measurements in the middle range (0.3-100 MHz), the cell is included into the break of the central conductor of a coaxial line of a large cross section. The admittance of the cell is determined by measuring the scattering matrix parameter S12 of the coaxial line of the large cross section. At frequencies below 1 MHz, the cell admittance is measured in the usual way by the LCR meter. Thus, CRP measurements of a substance placed in the same cell are carried out in the whole frequency range from 42 Hz to 8.5 GHz. The examples of CRP measurement of soils with different values of the dielectric constants and loss factors are given. It is shown that the CRP measurement error depends on the values of CRP and frequency. The measurement result error of relative dielectric permittivity obtained with the aid of this method is from 0.4\% to 2\%.},

Four levels of soil moisture content (oven dry, 33\% field capacity, 66\% field capacity and 100\% field capacity) were maintained to perform the experiment with three replication and three observation each. The results showed that, with increasing soil moisture, from oven dry conditions to 100\% field capacity, both the real (Dielectric Constant) and imaginary (Loss Factor) components of the dielectric properties increased; however, the responses were not linear. The dielectric properties of oven dry soils were very low compared with the soils with higher moisture content. Therefore, soil moisture was the major contributor to the dielectric behaviour of soil. The dielectric properties of sandy soil were much lower than the other soils; however, the dielectric loss factor of the Dookie clay soil was higher compare with the other soils. Models were developed to explain the dielectric properties of soils as a function of frequency and moisture content. The goodness of fit (r2) for these models varies between 0.952 for the Dookie Sandy Soil to 0.997 for the Dookie Loam Soil, suggesting that these models were adequate to describe the dielectric properties of these soils over the range of frequencies and moisture contents assessed in this study. Another model was developed to estimate the expected penetration depth of electromagnetic waves in these soils, based on the model of the dielectric properties. It was clear that penetration decreases with both frequency and moisture content. Low frequencies penetrate further into the soils than higher frequencies. Similarly, dry soils allow further penetration than moist soils.},
