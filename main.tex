\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
    We present a unique Open-Ended Coaxial Probe that can accurately measure the permittivity of heterogeneous materials, such as soil, due to its large aperture.
    The probe works at frequencies ranging from \qtyrange{0.5}{18}{\giga\hertz}, which is a particularly important range for microwave remote sensing applications, and more precisely the \ac{tsmm}.
    \ac{tsmm} aims at launching a new satellite equipped with a dual Ku-band radar (\qtyrange[range-phrase=~and~]{13.5}{17.2}{\giga\hertz}) for snow monitoring.
    At Ku-band frequencies, the backscattered radar signal contains information not only about the snow, but also about the soil underneath the snow.
    Knowing the soil permittivity will allow to better account for the soil contribution to the total radar signal and to obtain more accurate snow data such as the \ac{swe}.
    To demonstrate the accuracy of the probe and the repeatability of the measures, calibration solutions of known permittivity were measured, and the results were compared to their theoretical values.
    Then, we conducted tests for approximating the penetration depth of the probe signal with dry and wet paper.
    Afterwards, a protocol to use the probe to compute the permittivity of soil samples in freeze/thaw cycles was developed.
    The permittivity of commercial sand and arctic organic soil from Iqaluktuuttiaq (Cambridge Bay, Nunavut, Canada) are presented for different relevant frequencies for microwave remote sensing applications, and for different temperatures (\qtyrange{-20}{20}{\degreeCelsius}) according to the new protocol.
    This paper mainly aims at presenting the probe and its potential use in microwave remote sensing applications, especially for the active Ku-band, where little research exists.
